<h3>Set up</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I used  intellij Idea for this small project! You can use eclips or any other IDE</li>
  <li>Create a Maven Webapp Archetype </li>
  <li>Setup tomcat in intellij </li>
</ul>
<p>Now You can download this repo and test it!.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the folder <a href="src/main/webapp/META-INF">webapp/META-INF/</a> we have created a context.xml file where we have configured the pool connection for data connection for multiple request</p>
<p>Using DataSource interface to connect the connection pool</p>
<p>Performing the queries in the way we do in JDBC</p>
<p>To forward the generated data in the servlet to jsp I have used Request Dispatcher.</p>
<p>Instead of request Dispatcher we can also use Sessions, Cookies </p>
